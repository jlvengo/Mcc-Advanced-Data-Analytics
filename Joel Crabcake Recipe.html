<p>1 tbsp. Dijon mustard</p>
<p>2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning</p>
<p>1 tbsp. snipped parsley</p>
<p>1 egg (or substitute for special diets)</p>
<p>tartar sauce or cocktail sauce</p>

<p>Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top. Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, taking care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.</p>

<p>Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick. Shape should be like a cookie, not like a meatball or golf ball. Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking. This is very important so the cakes don't fall apart.</p>

<p><b>Broil the Crab Cakes:</b></p>
<p>Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned, turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>

<p><b>Or saute:</b></p>
<p>Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in a skillet and saute the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown or about 8 minutes total cooking time.</p>

<p>Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard, or cocktail sauce on the side.</p>
